    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid skier and novice
      ice climber. During the warmer months here in Colorado, I enjoy mountain biking, free climbing, and kayaking.</p>
    <p>When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef,
      and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the front-end web development
      world.</p>
